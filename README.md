# Report spam calls more easily :switzerland:

Simplify the process of reporting spam callers in Switzerland

## This is a work in progress

So far this repository is only a placeholder, more content like scripts and some prototype software will be uploaded next.

The end goal is to create an easy to use web platform to report a spam caller to all the relevant authorities. Thus feeding it into official databases (hopefully) to label it properly (with the *local.ch* app for instance) and block it [see here](https://github.com/chrismeunier/begone-swiss-spam-blacklist).

## Roadmap

- âœ… Scripts to autofill reporting webforms (SECO, FRC, ...)
- âœ… GUI to automate the process (tkinter)
- ðŸ”³ App accessible as a website
- ðŸ”³ Translate the website for Switzerland (DE+FR+IT)
- ðŸ”³ ...
